You made it to my personal website. Either you’re mildly curious, very bored, or trying to decide if you should interview me.

All three are valid.

This place is where I write about software engineering, technical leadership, and the part of product development that lives between “idea on a slide” and “oh no, real users are touching this”.

## What to Expect

I write about code, but not in the “here’s a perfect toy example” way.

Expect real-world engineering problems, tradeoffs that aged badly, architectures that looked clever until traffic hit, and the occasional “this was on fire and here’s how we pretended it was fine”.

I’ll also talk about leading engineers. Hiring, career paths, delegation, saying no to “quick wins”, and the subtle art of getting a team to ship something without burning them out or turning into process theatre.

There’ll be posts on career stuff too. Growing from “person who writes code” to “person who’s accidentally in charge”, and how to do that without losing the technical side completely.

And because tools matter more than anyone wants to admit, I’ll cover how I work day to day. Editors, automation, pipelines, rituals that keep projects moving instead of drowning in busywork.

## Why I'm Writing

Writing forces me to be honest about how I think. If I can’t explain a topic clearly, I probably don’t understand it as well as I think I do.

If you’re dealing with similar problems, there’s a chance something here will save you a few hours, a sprint, or an incident review that should’ve been an email.

It’s also a log for myself. Decisions, experiments, messes, and the occasional win, written down so future me can’t rewrite history.

And yes, it’s a signal. If you’re a hiring manager or founder, this is a better way to get a sense of how I think than a bullet-point CV or a whiteboard array problem.

## If You’re Still Reading

I won’t promise a specific posting schedule. I ship when there’s something worth saying, not to hit a content calendar.

If that sounds useful, check back once in a while, or reach out if something I write hits a nerve.

Thanks for stopping by.
