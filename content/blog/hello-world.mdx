Welcome to my new personal website! I'm excited to have a space where I can share my thoughts on software engineering, technical leadership, and the craft of building great products.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a variety of topics:

- **Engineering**: Deep dives into technical challenges, architecture decisions, and code
- **Leadership**: Lessons learned from leading engineering teams
- **Career**: Reflections on growing as a developer and manager
- **Tools & Workflows**: Reviews and recommendations for developer tools

## Why Write?

Writing helps me think more clearly about complex topics. By sharing my experiences and lessons learned, I hope to:

1. Help others facing similar challenges
2. Document my own learning journey
3. Connect with like-minded engineers

## Stay Tuned

I'm planning to publish new content regularly. If you're interested in following along, feel free to check back or connect with me on social media.

Thanks for reading!
