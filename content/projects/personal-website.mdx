## Overview

This is my personal website and blog, designed with a focus on simplicity, performance, and developer experience. The site features a "sidefolio" layout with a persistent sidebar navigation and content-focused pages.

## Design Philosophy

The design is inspired by Vercel's aesthetic - dark, minimal, and focused on content. I've added personality through the use of the Silkscreen pixel font for headings and navigation, creating a subtle retro touch without being overwhelming.

## Technical Highlights

### Content Management

Blog posts and projects are stored as MDX files, allowing me to write content in Markdown while having the flexibility to include React components when needed. The content is validated using Zod schemas to ensure type safety.

### Performance

The site is built with Next.js App Router for optimal performance:

- Static generation for content pages
- Optimized font loading with `next/font`
- Minimal JavaScript bundle

### Animations

Subtle animations using Framer Motion enhance the user experience without being distracting. All animations respect the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting.

## What I Learned

Building this site was a great exercise in:

- Designing a content architecture that scales
- Implementing type-safe MDX with Zod validation
- Creating a cohesive design system with Tailwind CSS
