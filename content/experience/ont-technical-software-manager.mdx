I manage a team of four software engineers. This involves the usual suspects: mentoring, objectives, performance reviews, and convincing people that their work matters — because it does.

Most of my time goes into building internal developer tools: log aggregation platforms, deployment management apps, and dashboards that make platform operations slightly less painful. The stack is React, NextJS, Electron, Typescript and Python, depending on what needs hitting.

A significant portion of my sanity has gone into making C++ builds behave like civilized software. Conan, CMake, Docker, Artifactory. Some engineers are converts. Others look at me like I've suggested we rewrite everything in Rust.
