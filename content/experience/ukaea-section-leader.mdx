Led a software development team. Mentored engineers, allocated work, ran reviews, hired people. The leadership trifecta.

I was a key contributor to CorteX – RACE's robotic middleware for distributed systems. This meant integrating with ROS2, Qt, OPC-UA, and EtherCAT, plus building interfaces for industrial manipulators using whatever proprietary API the hardware vendor decided to inflict on us.

Helped put CI/CD pipelines and Git workflows in place. Infrastructure work - the sort that only gets mentioned when its missing.
