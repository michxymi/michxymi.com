Core team member on CorteX from the early days. Wrote cross-platform code in modern C++ and Python. Built monitoring and control interfaces in Qt. Wrote tests. Ran Valgrind until the memory leaks stopped haunting me.

I was the primary technical contact for external partners and supervised year-in-industry students who were somehow even more confused than I was when I started.
